                Hi! I'm Cesar, a mechanical engineer student with great foundation in CAD design and prototyping. My interest lie in renewable energy, autonomous vehicles,
                and propulsion technologies. 
                In my free time, I love to play music, and cook good food.
                I use this website to track the projects I do. If you have questions for me, please contact me at <a href="mailto:cesar.briones.aranda@gmail.com">cesar.briones.aranda@gmail.com.</a>

                                    Took the role of lead systems engineer to conduct the preliminary design of a life exploration rover, 
                                    with a scientific focus on the Ocrator crater of the drawf planet Ceres.

                                    I loved working with this team, 15 students from different universities across the nation. Naturally, the project was completely remote.
                                    It was challenging to work online; but eventually, the team got used to it.

                                    In this program, we had to pass 4 reports, including Mission Concept Review (MCR), System Requirements Review (SRR), Mission Definition Review (MDR), and Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
                                    These reports are available upon request.

                            <p>I recreated the design of the Sentry Turret from the Portal franchise, focusing on design similarity and mechanical features.
                                In particular, I prototyped an internal mechanism to rotate and extended the sentry's wings, allowing for movement and rotation.

                                I started this project due to the amusing idea of having an stationary Sentry Turret in my room.
                                Therefore, my goal is to 3D print this model and make it functional
